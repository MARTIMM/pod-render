## CHANGELOG

See [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). Please note point 4. on
that page: *Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may
change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable.*

* 0.3.0 Add support for MD and pdf.
* 0.2.0 Start making a program to do the rendering
* 0.1.0 Tried to 'use PodRender'. Works now but has a minor impact when not to render.
* 0.0.1 Setup
